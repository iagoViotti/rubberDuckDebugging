# RubberDuck Debugging  ðŸ¦†

RubberDuckDebugging is a single-page application built with React and TypeScript. It simulates a chat where you can "talk" to a rubber duck, following the well-known Rubber Duck Debugging technique.

## Features

 - **Interactive Chat**: Engage in a conversation with a virtual rubber duck to help debug your code by talking through the problem.
 - **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface designed to keep your focus on solving problems.
